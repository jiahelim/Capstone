    "#### Business Problem\n",
    "Watering holes often cluster together in certain areas forming up enclaves. For people new to town it takes quite a bit of research to plan a great night out for crawling pubs as no matter how Epic the night is, often the are trade offs to be made in choosing which places to visit. By finding clusters, we could maximize satisfaction as time spent on drunkely commuting would be reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Audience\n",
    "Other than drink lovers - From a business oriented view many other audience could benefit from the same approach - tour guides/ airbnb experienece providers / hosts often would need to route plan and know which areas could maximize their client's satisfaction with the greatest convenience. Foursquare location data could help us reveal these cluster through mining the review and position data.\n",

    "We would be using Singapore as an sample for the above approach, and subset to only the best venues\n",
